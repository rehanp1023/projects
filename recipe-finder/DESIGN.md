# Recipe Finder - Design Document

## Overview
Recipe Finder is a web application designed to help users find recipes based on the ingredients they have. This document provides a technical overview of the project, including the architecture, design decisions, and implementation details. The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly tool that helps users discover new recipes and make better use of their ingredients.

## Architecture
The application is built using the Flask web framework. The Spoonacular API is used to fetch recipe data based on user input. The main components of the application include the frontend (HTML templates), the backend (Flask routes and logic), and the integration with the Spoonacular API.

### Frontend
The frontend is built using HTML and Bootstrap for styling. The main templates include:
- **index.html**: The main page where users can input ingredients.
- **recipes.html**: Displays the list of recipes based on the user's input.
- **recipe_details.html**: Shows detailed information about a selected recipe.

The frontend is designed to be user-friendly, with a clean and intuitive interface. Bootstrap is used to ensure that the layout is responsive and looks good on different devices. The templates are rendered by Flask, and they include forms for user input and sections to display the fetched recipes.

### Backend
The backend is built using Flask, which handles routing, form processing, and template rendering. The main routes in the application include:
- **Index Route**: Displays the main page with the form for ingredient input.
- **Recipes Route**: Processes the form input, fetches recipes from the Spoonacular API, and displays the results.

Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, allowing for easy setup and quick development. The backend logic handles user input, communicates with the Spoonacular API, and processes the API responses to display the relevant recipe information.

### API Integration
The Spoonacular API is used to fetch recipes based on the ingredients provided by the user. This API offers a comprehensive dataset for recipes, making it a suitable choice for the application. The integration is handled through HTTP requests using the `requests` library. The `search_recipes` function is responsible for making the API request and processing the response. It constructs the request URL, sends the request, and parses the JSON response to extract the recipe data.

## Design Decisions
### Flask Framework
Flask was chosen due to its simplicity and flexibility. It allows for easy setup and quick development, making it an ideal choice for this project. Flaskâ€™s extensive documentation and large community support also contribute to this decision.

### API Integration
The Spoonacular API was selected because it provides a wide range of recipe data, including ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. This API is well-documented and easy to integrate, making it a reliable choice for fetching recipe data based on user input.

### Frontend Design
The frontend is designed using HTML templates rendered by Flask. The design aims to provide a clean and intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to search for recipes and view detailed information.

## Error Handling
Robust error handling is implemented to manage various potential issues. For example:
- If the user does not provide any ingredients, a message is displayed prompting them to enter ingredients.
- If the API request fails or returns an error, an appropriate message is displayed to the user.
- If the JSON response from the API cannot be parsed, an error message is logged, and the user is informed of the issue.

The application also includes try-except blocks to catch exceptions and handle errors gracefully.
